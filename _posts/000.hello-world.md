Hello, world!

That's the beginning of it all. The beginning of BaBaP.

This is Jonathan Lam, programmer of BaBaP. And while I won't be writing for this blog, I will be monitoring and updating this website. Jessica Lam will be the primary author of this blog. If you *would* like to read my math, programming, and/or literary gibberish, then head on over to my blog, [Everything is Sheep][1].

That's it for now! Basic blog functionality is established on BaBaP, but that "Map" tab up there is not (see the "About" tab for more details.). Toodly-doo!
